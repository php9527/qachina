Fix Pixelated Fonts
Some websites such as github.com tend to use bitmap font from X11, named Clean.
Easy fix is to disable bitmap fonts, run:
# ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-no-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/

Midori supports all the standard keyboard shortcuts -- I could open a new tab with Ctrl+T, go to the address bar using Ctrl+L, go to the search bar using Ctrl+K, save a bookmark using Ctrl+D or navigate between tabs using Alt+1, Alt+2, etc.

Tweaking Midori on the Gtk level

If you don't have a desktop application that takes care of Gtk settings or if your interface doesn't support a particular feature, you can modify any settings easily manually by specifying them in a text file called ~/.gtkrc-2.0 or /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:

Use Tango as a fallback for your icon theme:

gtk-icon-theme-name = "MySuperFancyTheme"
gtk-fallback-icon-theme = "Tango"
Use a smaller toolbar:

gtk-toolbar-icon-size = GTK_ICON_SIZE_SMALL_TOOLBAR
Only for those not running a complete DE like Xfce, Elementary, etc…
There is a preference: Preferences → Browsing → Toolbar Style: Small icons

Enable changing hotkeys while hovering menu items:

gtk-can-change-accels = 1
Disable middle click pasting

As of GTK+ >= 3.4 one can disable it globally in ~/.gtkrc-2.0

gtk-enable-primary-paste = 0
Otherwise by adding a line to ~/.config/midori/config

middle-click-opens-selection=false


How can I change the cache folder (to tmpfs)?

On Linux and BSD, you can set XDG_CACHE_HOME for all applications, or just Midori. Midori saves icons and cache files in that location. The default is ~/.cache.

export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/dev/shm

Netscape plugins on Linux, BSD and OS X

You need to set MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH, for example like this:

export MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH="/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins"
The official Flash plugin is called libflashplayer.so .

You can either run that above line and run Midori in the same terminal afterwards or, for the long term, put it in ~/.bash_profile or /etc/profile.d or your respective distribution's place for this.

HTTPS URLS won't load

That's a problem with WebKit. You can work around it to some extent if you start Midori like so:

export WEBKIT_IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS="1" midori
